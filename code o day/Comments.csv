51182413,Katie,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"I read this book in Vietnamese about five or six years back, when I first came to the U.S. I remember bringing this book from Vietnam as a gift from my cousin, whom I refer to as sister. This is a very lovely book from Nguyễn Nhật Ánh; he captures the easy-going, and exciting life of many Vietnamese children very well, and of course, this book was not written for children, rather, it was for adults who want a ticket back to their childhoods, a trip down the memory lane. This book serves that pur",What a lovely review! :)
18885455,Becky,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"I had a good five minute long internal debate with myself before reviewing this book because I read the translated work (the book is originally in Vietnamese) and I have mixed feelings about the book. I wonder if the reason I didn't enjoy the book is because of the content or because of how the original content was translated. With The Man with Compound Eyes, translation seemed pretty on point, with of course, some liberty taken for the sake of cohesion... Of course, I know Mandarin much better ","You are totally right. This guy tends to wander in his own thoughts and as time went by, his writings got more and more incoherent. He kept using sentences like ""Back then, the girl used to do this and that"", ""A while ago, I did not use to do this and that"", ""Back then, my mother/grandmother used to do this and that"". I remember there was one time I was reading his book, and within 3 paragraphs, he jumped from present day to the past and to the present day again, then to the past, and then to the present day again good LORD. And within that 3 paragraphs, he had like used his ""Back then..."" 3-4 times. After that I kind of gave up on him. His writing is no doubt the 'friendliest' Vietnamese lit out there, and can be read by anybody, but my advice would be that you should read his books that were written before 2000."

I actually had to read this one part thrice because he said he ended up doing this... and in the next part he said oh but I didn't.Turns out, he did it in his childhood while playacting with friends, but in real life he didn't actually do it.Seriously..."
