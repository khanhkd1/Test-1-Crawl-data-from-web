27300702,GlassyPizzaFingers,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"I read this book in Vietnamese about five or six years back, when I first came to the U.S. I remember bringing this book from Vietnam as a gift from my cousin, whom I refer to as sister. This is a very lovely book from Nguyễn Nhật Ánh; he captures the easy-going, and exciting life of many Vietnamese children very well, and of course, this book was not written for children, rather, it was for adults who want a ticket back to their childhoods, a trip down the memory lane. This book serves that pur",5,"Jan 03, 2016"
35043057,Renae,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"I had a good five minute long internal debate with myself before reviewing this book because I read the translated work (the book is originally in Vietnamese) and I have mixed feelings about the book. I wonder if the reason I didn't enjoy the book is because of the content or because of how the original content was translated. With The Man with Compound Eyes, translation seemed pretty on point, with of course, some liberty taken for the sake of cohesion... Of course, I know Mandarin much better ",1,"Mar 25, 2015"
18931036,Shannon Lee,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,Just the sweetest. This is a fast and enjoyable read and truly blurs the line between fiction and biography. This should be required reading for grown ups; it is impossible to read this without recollecting the forgotten magic of childhood and the anguish of having to grow up and away from innocence. ,4,"Dec 29, 2014"

1918609,Thomas Andrikus,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"The frequent contrasting between childhood and adulthood made by the author is reminiscent of the famous French work ""The Little Prince"" and the Japanese novel ""Totto-chan"".The main differences is that these stories told by Mui take place in our actual world (instead of a fantasy world) and are based in Vietnam. I even suspect that the meta-story of how Mui recounts his own childhood from his 40-year-old self is merely a semi-autobiographical account by the actual author himself.Anyway, this nov",5,"May 30, 2015"
5258312,Anh,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"This book was a phenomenon when it was first published in Vietnam, partly because of the author's fame, partly because the book itself is truly wonderful: a queer sense of humor, extraordinary thoughts that suit all type of readers: kids, teenagers and adults. I never liked Nguyễn Nhật Ánh and actually distaste his previous books entirely, but to my surprise I found this book hard to put down once started!",4,"Apr 12, 2011"
32952691,Bagus,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"Nguyen Nhat Anh has said about this book that he did not write this book for children, but instead he wrote it to those who used to be children. And indeed as I flipped between the pages in this book, it was as though there is this voice who's speaking to the Inner Child inside my mind. Indeed, Inner Child has been one of the most interesting research topics in popular psychology. The term Inner Child corresponds to individual childlike's aspects that keep embodying our minds even as we grow old",4,"Apr 22, 2020"
28438187,Brandy Navetta,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"Rich with one liners and moments where you'll laugh aloud. Just one to share here: ""Adults like to keep the cobwebs out of their attics - to clean up the past. But when you brush those cobwebs away, you may be brushing off diamond dust."" Translated into English from Vietnamese. You'll be a more informed and developed reader of literature by experiencing this short fiction piece. ",4,"Nov 03, 2016"

Just step out of the shallow man=made canal and into deep water. p155TNA may be having us on here, as he considers possibilities for framing this story of innocence and inevitability. Is this memoir, documentary fiction, or fantasy? Can our memories redeem themselves?

18203243,Stuart,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"A very enjoyable slice of childhood. A short read, the author recounts various episodes of his time growing up in Vietnam. This is in the same style as another very good book called ""Totto-chan: The girl in the Window"" (life in Japan as a child). It is a pleasant recollection of a childhood adventures that reminded me of Mark Twain's writing. The author breaks the barrier between himself as a character and himself as an author with an occasional wink to his reader. He also does a good job in poi",4,"Jan 04, 2015"
3093151,Lindsey Sparks,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"I almost returned this to the library unread since I'm trying to read my own books, but I'm glad I didn't. It's a short little book, only about 140 pages, but it did a great job at capturing childhood, or more clearly, an adult's memory of childhood. I liked seeing how someone growing up across the world from me could have similar childhood memories. It reads like a memoir and felt very real, even though it's a novel (or is it?). It made me think about all of my memories of playing with the kids",3,"Jan 04, 2016"

36432305,Michael Haase,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"There's is eloquence in simplicity, it is sometimes said, and I found that to be the case with this novel. It is a short but impactful recall to the creativity and enthusiastic wonder that defines childhood and contrasts the abundant monotony of adulthood. I finished this book in between 2-3 hours and loved any bit of it. How relieving it felt after the weeks I've spent reading huge, 500+ page volumes filled to the brim with blandness. Moreover, I commend the author for being able to capture the",4,"Jul 13, 2017"

I finally read it yesterday (thanks to COVID-19 lockdown) and take my sweet time reading it. It is a children’s book made for adults, hence the title. I smiled all the way through reading it and smiled upon finishing it. What a great book. A simple but thought provoking one. It will be a book I will reread again and again and again.

3885089,Daniel Kukwa,Cho Tôi Xin Một Vé Đi Tuổi Thơ,"Is this really a novel, or a memoir masquerading as a novel? I'm not sure...but I did enjoy the experience. In its exploration of childhood, reflected in the eyes of adults, it's sweet, outrageous, funny, and poignant. It treats the fourth wall between writer and reader like a permeable membrane, and the end result is something slightly kooky and off-centre, but joyously entertaining.",4,"Jun 27, 2018"
